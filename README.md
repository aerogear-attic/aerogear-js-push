### Grunt

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used as the build tool which requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) version >= 0.10.
Please refer to [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) for details regarding installing Node.js.
Please refer to Grunt's [getting started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide for details regarding installing Grunt.

### Installing Build Dependencies
To install the dependencies of the project run the following command:

    $ npm install

This will install the versions of the dependencies declared in package.json. This is only required to be done once before
building the first time, or if the dependencies in package.json have been updated.

### Building the project

    $ grunt

The produced JavaScript will be in the __dist__ directory.
